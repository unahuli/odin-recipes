        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And I’ve got to say, it’s definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo.</p>
