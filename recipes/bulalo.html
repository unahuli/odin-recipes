        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One might classify bulalo as a kind of nilaga –– after all, there doesn’t seem to be much difference in ingredients, nor in the cooking process. But what sets bulalo apart is the very specific choice of meat we use for it. The star of a great bulalo is always the meat –– more specifically, the use of beef shank, with marrow still inside the bone. The meat of bulalo is famous for melting in your mouth, practically falling off the bone with how tender it becomes! Doesn’t the mere thought of it make your mouth water?</p>
